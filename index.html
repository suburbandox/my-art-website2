            Design  Style: I do not really have a style of my own yet, but I would like to develop  an Art Deco style <br>
           In Design Fundamentals, I  have learned elements of basic design theory and principals, including:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>The  Gestalt theory of visual perception, which explains why some shapes are more  visually pleasing, and how to use shapes to communicate to the viewer. The  brain perceives more than the eye sees.</li>
             <li>Color  theory, which describes why different colors complement or clash with each  other. Color is an important design element that helps the artist deliver a  message.  Colors have hue, intensity, and  value. They can be made by addition or subtraction. The primary colors are red,  yellow, and blue. These cannot be made by mixing other colors.  When mixed, the primary colors make secondary  (green, violet, and orange) and tertiary colors. Colors can be warm (red,  orange, yellow) or cool (blues and greens). Combining colors together changes  how they are seen. Complementary colors are opposite each other on the color  wheel.  Colors work with other design  elements to evoke emotions. </li>
             <li>Typography  is designing with type, using fonts, type styles, and type size.  To use types effectively, it is important to  use fonts that are not too fancy, because that makes them hard to read.  Different fonts and styles are used in  different settings. </li>
             <li>Geometry  is very important in creating shapes that are proportionally related to each  other.  It can be used to prove a point,  and to decide where lines should be added. </li>
           </ul>
           <p>I  learned the basics of using woodshop tools to make models.<br>
             Programs  that I learned how to use include Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Autodesk  CAD, Dream Weaver, and 3Ds Max. </p>
